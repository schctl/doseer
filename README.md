# m7

`m7` is an graphical file manager created for my own personal use.

It was born out of some mild annoyances with the file manager I already use, and the fact that I
couldn't find anything I liked better.

The main *raison d'être* of `m7` is experimentation — it aims to add features that are typically not
seen in file managers, and be more than *just* a file manager. I don't know how much innovation can
be done in a file manager, but it will live on if it succeeds in its goal. It is also an excuse for
me to write code and play around with [`iced`] :)

**Some ideas:**

- Tags and Collections ([See this awesome concept by Avdan](https://youtu.be/7ZEYQ30iBTc?t=90))
- Plugins
- Built-in file sharing tools
